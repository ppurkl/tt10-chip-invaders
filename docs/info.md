## How it works

Implementation of the Space Invaders game in Verilog. Use inputs 0 and 1 to move the player to the right and to the left respectively. To shoot at the aliens, press button 2. It is intended that the game is played using the TinyTapeout Commander app. Via the app the keyboard of the computer can be used to set the input pins of the ASIC. 

## How to test

Set the inputs and check the outputs. TinyTapeout VGA Playground is the preferred way of testing. 

## External hardware

List external hardware used in your project (e.g. PMOD, LED display, etc), if any
